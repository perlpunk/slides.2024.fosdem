  [*]General tests under t/*.t
  [*]API tests under t/api
  [*]UI tests under t/ui
  [*]For UI we are using Selenium
  [*]The tests themselves are included in coverage
  [*]We are using Codecov to report Test Coverage
  [*]But we also use openQA to test openQA :)

  [list animation="1,greyin"]
  [*]Some of our tests are forking
  [*]They should probably be turned into real unit tests
  [*]But still Devel::Cover is able to track coverage with this:
  [/list]
  [codebox animation="10,greyin"]# at the end of the forked process
  Devel::Cover::report() if Devel::Cover->can('report');
  [/codebox]

  [list animation="1,greyin"]
  [*]Codecov will complain if a PR adds uncovered code
  [*]It will also complain if the percentage goes below a threshold
  [*]Some directories are marked as fully covered, so it will complain
  if one of the files has uncovered lines
  [*]We use GitHub's [url=https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA/blob/master/.mergify.yml]mergify[/url] bot
  [*]Two approvals and no failing test will automatically merge the PR

  [list animation="1,greyin"]
  [*]Checking code coverage might not be enough
  [*]PR authors are encouraged to add new tests for every PR, if necessary
  [*]Writing tests is seen as part of every ticket we work on
  [*]Also refactoring is encouraged
  [*]For every regression, we encourage people to think what we could do
  to prevent similar things in the future
